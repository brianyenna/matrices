# Matrices

This is a project I am currently experimenting on.

I am trying to implement a matrix class that has a presentation more reminiscent of the matrices I am accustomed to in Math lessons. I understand that way more efficient packages exist out there that already provide this functionality (e.g. numpy, pandas etc.), but I wanted to give it a try myself. If anything, it's just a means for me to learn something new.

I also implemented a linear regression algorithm in the linearRegression.py file. It uses gradient descent to determine the coefficient values of a model. It is quite poorly implemented as of now, but I'll work on it.
