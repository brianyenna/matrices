# Matrices

In this repository, I am trying to implement a matrix class that would enable me to work with matrices. I understand that way more efficient packages exist out there that would already give me that functionality (e.g. numpy, pandas etc.), but I wanted to give it a try myself. If anything, it's just a means for me to learn something new.

I also implemented a linear regression algorithm in the linearRegression.py file. It uses gradient descent to determine the coefficient values of a model. It is quite poorly implemented as of now, but I'll work on it.
